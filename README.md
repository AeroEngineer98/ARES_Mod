# DCS World Scaled Composites ARES

I took this format from the community A-29 Super Tucano. From that Readme:

"This is a free, open source, SFM, A-29B independent module for DCS World. By independent it is meant that it does not require any other modules to work.
The development is in a very early stage, but the author has decided on releasing it in hopes it will help others on the implementation of modern aircraft systems using SFM.
All aircraft systems are implemented in Lua and can be freely used in other non-paid DCS World Modules."

This mod is my first foray into the modding world of DCS. I've created the 3D model from a 3-view posted to Facebook from Scaled, plus my own experiences with the airplane.

- Upgraded the HUD which now has a flight path marker, airpseed, and altitude.
- Changed the HUD font to be a Futura-based font with a custom texture file
- Removed much of the flight controls logic in the flight model to better approximate a reversible-controls aircraft
- Changed the flight model to inclue N1, N2, and better thrust modeling so I can add N1 and N2 gauges that look more realistic


### February 17, 2023 Commit
- Added a HUD that shows a very basic pitch ladder. A big win!


### February 10, 2023 Commit
- Added a clickable gear handle
- Added gear and speedbrake indicators
- Added a day/night dimmer switch

- Firtst commit with a working cockpit gauge by passing data from the flight model to the lua scripts


### January 20, 2023 Commit
- Removed a lot of extra cockpit scripts that were unused and left-over from the A-29


### January 18, 2023 Commit
- Added a LOD file in order to add a collision mesh
- Added a "Suspension.lua" file for keeping track of suspension terms


### January 15, 2023 Commit
- Separated the cockpit model from the rest of the plane for future cockpit work
- Moved the viewpoint to be realistic - could still move forward a bit more.
- Retextured the cockpit with Zolatone!


### Initial Commit - January 14, 2023
- Changed from a simple flight model (SFM) to an external flight model (EFM) using IGServal's "Basic-custom-flight-model-for-DCS-World-main" flight model. Animations are either spotty or don't work, and there's too much stuff that's not applicable to ARES that's still in the mod.
