# DCS World Scaled Composites ARES

I took this format from the community A-29 Super Tucano. From that Readme:

"This is a free, open source, SFM, A-29B independent module for DCS World. By independent it is meant that it does not require any other modules to work.
The development is in a very early stage, but the author has decided on releasing it in hopes it will help others on the implementation of modern aircraft systems using SFM.
All aircraft systems are implemented in Lua and can be freely used in other non-paid DCS World Modules."

This mod is my first foray into the modding world of DCS. I've created the 3D model from a 3-view posted to Facebook from Scaled, plus my own experiences with the airplane.

### Initial Commit - January 14, 2023
- Changed from a simple flight model (SFM) to an external flight model (EFM) using IGServal's "Basic-custom-flight-model-for-DCS-World-main" flight model. Animations are either spotty or don't work, and there's too much stuff that's not applicable to ARES that's still in the mod.
